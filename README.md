# pararius-scraping
This project consists in developing a python solution for scraping multiple list pages on a website.
From now it can only be used in websites like pararius that do not have a serious antibot protection
since it is very rudimentary.
However it may be used as a orientative example for future projects or evolve into a more sophisticated version of itself.
